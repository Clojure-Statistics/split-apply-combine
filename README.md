# split-apply-combine

This is a sample implementation of ddply and some other R type stuff that I did for my June 2013 presentation to the Bay Area Clojure Users Group.

This is not meant to be a complete implementation, but rather as a demonstration of the Split-Apply-Combine concepts proposed by Hadley Wickham in his paper _The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis_ (Journal of Statistical Software, April 2011, Volume 40, Issue 1) and implemented in the plyr library. See [http://plyr.had.co.nz](http://plyr.had.co.nz) for more information on the plyr project.
